# Content Undefined Issue Fix

## Changes Made:

✅ **routes/web.php**: Updated `/home` route to pass `content` prop from session with default value 'home'
✅ **LoginController.php**: Fixed session content setting to use null coalescing operator with default 'home'
✅ **Home.jsx**: Added fallback to 'home' when content is undefined

## Testing Required:

1. **Login Test**: Try logging in again and check if the console.log shows the content value instead of undefined
2. **Default Page Test**: Verify that after login, the home page loads with the Discussion component by default
3. **Navigation Test**: Test that navigation between different sections (Discussion, Jobs, Marketplace, etc.) works properly

## Expected Behavior:
- After successful login, `content` should be 'home' instead of undefined
- The Discussion component should load by default
- Navigation should work without errors
